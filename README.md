## Hello There!

I'm an ardent Linux user, primarily immersing myself in the realms of Gentoo and Arch Linux with fervor :D

Honestly, `apt` just feels too messy for me. `pacman` and `emerge` just much better >_>

### Proficiencies

I've practically lived and breathed Linux commands for more years than I've had meals – it's safe to say I've typed them more frequently than I've eaten! (XD)

- Linux (Over 7 years of user)
- Python (Web Crawling)
- C# (.NET and GUI for Windows)
- C++ (Memory Addresses)
- Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS
- Bash Scripting
- Penetration Testing: Proficient with a variety of pentesting tools
- Reverse Engineering: game hacking level

And currently, I'm immersing myself in the realms of Go and Rust languages.

### Pastimes

I find solace in indulging in pure love anime; however, I strongly dislike anything involving NTR >_>

Furthermore, I've developed a profound affection for the command line. BTW, I use zsh, kitty and Hyprland :3
