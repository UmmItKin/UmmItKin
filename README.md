## Keyboard ‚å®Ô∏è

Also, as a split keyboard user, I'm currently using the ZSA Moonlander keyboard. This keyboard has changed my life so far.

## CTF Player üö©

As cybersecurity enthusiasts, I also play CTFs when I can. Currently, I'm a team member of [ICEDTEA (ÂÜ∞Ëå∂Êà∞Èöä)](https://ic3dt3a.org/).

I'm also preparing for my first penetration testing certification - the CPTS (yes, not the OSCP, as it's too expensive for me right now). Hack The Box offers better value for me. and more harder i like it more.
