## CTF Player

As cybersecurity enthusiasts, I also play CTFs when I can. Currently, I'm a team member of [ICEDTEA (冰茶戰隊)](https://ic3dt3a.org/).

I'm also preparing for my first penetration testing certification - the CPTS (yes, not the OSCP, as it's too expensive for me right now). Hack The Box offers better value for me. and more harder i like it more.

I use Arch as my daily driver, Debian/Raspberry Pi for servers, and am currently trying out NixOS, which seems very maintainable for server use.
